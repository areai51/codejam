Thank You for downloading codejam !

INSTRUCTIONS !

You can attempt anyone of the assignments.
Details of each assignment are present in their respective folders.

You are required to complete the assignment and upload and setup the working application on a Webserver (We recommend pagodabox.com or any LAMP server of your preference). You are also required to commit the code to Github and send us the github URL.

There is no timelimit to complete the assignment, we however will be shortlisting on a first come first serve basis.

The application should look & run well on IE9+, FireFox, Chrome & Safari.

You are free to use any technology or framework.
We obviously like to see good clean code following OOPs concepts and written using a MVC design pattern.

While the main focus is on programming, we are also looking to see your sense of designing skills and how well you are able to match your code to the design mockups provided, so make the best use of your CSS and jQuery skills.

Bonus points if your submission includes unit tests 

Once you have a working application deployed on the webserver and your code is in github, please send an email to codejam@neevtech.com with the following information:
